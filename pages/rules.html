                            youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
                            team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
                            this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                            background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</p>

                                the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                                assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                                whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                                from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
